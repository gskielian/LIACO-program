This program, called the LIACO program, runs lights in a consecutive order.  
LIACO stands for LEDs In A Consecutive Order (The name is pretty self-explanatory).  
You can see the schematics above, if you click the link or just copy it into your url.  

I used Fritzing for the program used to create the image of the breadboard and arduino.
